Hi!

[comment]: <> (I'm software developer with over 15 years of experience. In my work, I'm focusing mostly on server side technologies and Java language. Recently, I work in [Infobip](https://infobip.com) where I'm part of team working on [CPaaS](https://www.infobip.com/glossary/cpaas-communications-platform-as-a-service) solution.)


I'm Krzysztof and I'm software developer from Poland with over 15 years of commercial experience. I'm mainly focuses on JVM programming languages and technologies. During my career I was working on wide range of systems, including legacy and greenfield, monolithic and microservices. Developing core parts of products as well as building solutions on top of existing platforms.

Recently I work for [Infobip](//infobip.com), where I make and maintain microservices built with such technologies as Java, Kotlin, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, Project Reactor, Microsoft SQL Server and Kafka. Rarely I'm involved in maintaining .NET Core based services.

Besides Java and Kotlin, I was also programming in Groovy, Scala, PHP and tracking some bugs or doing optimizations in C++ app.

Fun facts:
- I started with writing embedded C code for AVR ATmega processors
- When I started my Enterprise Java journey, J2EE 1.4 was still a think. That was strange beast where you were mostly "programming" in Javadoc comments and XML
- Thing that I found most ridiculous was migrating module of application from EJB 3 to EJB 2.1 (well... it was politics not technical issues)
